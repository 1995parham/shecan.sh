## Introduction
Our country, Iran, is under tight sanctions, therefore, several websites preclude our people from their services.
[Shecan](http://shecan.ir/) is a DNS service that breaks these sanctions for the Iranian people.
These sanctions are unfair and disrupt many of our startups.

I have created this repository just for supporting this awesome organization.
